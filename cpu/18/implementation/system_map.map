ERROR:Pack:2310 - Too many comps of type "RAMB16BWER" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       248 out of   1,200   20%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,337
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           967 out of   2,337   41%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             406 out of   4,800    8%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
